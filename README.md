## üöÄ What is it about?


This project is from the Software Architecture class in the Information Systems master's program. The goal is to learn the basics of full stack application development with both front-end (website appearance, user interface with HTML & CSS) and back-end (site's architecture with Java and SQL) programming to build a website.

### Description of the project


The chosen project is a basic movie recommendation website where you can create a user, log in, then you can browse a movie catalogue (see the movie's information and read the reviews), add movies to your personal favourite list, and also get recommendations on what movies to watch depending on the genre (action, comedy, or drama).

The first phase consisted of back-end programming, with the basic model classes, their controllers, and views. We also created the exceptions (`AlreadyExistsException`: when the user enters an already existing username or email address when creating an account and `DoesNotExistException`: when the user tries to log in with the wrong information) and a basic database.

The second phase was creating the Java Web Application, with the beans (back-end) and designing the HTML pages and UI components (front-end). We created a Movie Home Page before logging in for users to see the movie catalogue and be able to create an account or log in. And a Movie User Page where users that are logged in can have movie recommendations for a chosen genre, see the catalogue, add and delete movies from their favourite list, and see their favourite list. Both pages come with a slide menu with the available user's actions.

The third phase was creating the MySQL database with a connection pool so that every user's information can be stored and remembered by the website (their information: email address, username, favourite list of movies).
